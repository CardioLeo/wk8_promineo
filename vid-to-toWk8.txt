Video Steps:
    • Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed. 
    • This video should be done using screen share and voice over. 
    • This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend. 
        ◦ You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording. 
        ◦ This will create a video recording on your computer. 
    • This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube. 
        ◦ Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!
        ◦ If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
