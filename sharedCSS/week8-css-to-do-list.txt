# Description: A place for me to keep up with minutiae of tasks regarding week 8 CSS coding project; but not concerned with non-CSS code tasks like making a video.

From coding assignment document:

"Coding Steps:
    • Style the website you made last week using CSS with the following requirements:
        ◦ Use only external CSS file (no internal or inline styling)
        ◦ Every element must be styled.
        ◦ Create style rules using class, id, and element selectors."

Subtasks:

---make list of every html element from wzcOnline //
---make list of HTML elements NOT already successfully meeting the criteria for the coding assignment
---start looking up creative ways to style the different elements
---look up creative style rules for class, id, & element
